# Luma Event Aggregator
Fetches events from several Luma calendar. Will enable user to filter them based on preference via AI (perhaps Perplexity)

Start and End times (start_at, end_at) appear to be in standard UTC timestamp. For filtering by dates and times, go by the user's time zone.

1. fetch events using `fetchEvents.py`, events go into fetchedEvents/[slug].json
